# Hello, Folks!

I'm Jeong. Currently, I'm working as a software engineer. I'm interested in web development, especially in **back-end development**. I'm also interested in **front-end and sofware-tools**. I'm trying to learn more about them.

```kotlin
fun hello() {
    println("Hello, Folks!")
}
```

Currently, I'm using **Kotlin** as a main language. I'm also using Java, Python, JavaScript, and even Go. I'm trying to learn more about them, too.
